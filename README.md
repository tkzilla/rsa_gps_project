This project incorporates a Tektronix USB RSA (Real-time Spectrum Analyzer) with a USB GPS antenna to capture and log both spectrum data and GPS timestamps/location information. It consists of a backend script and a GUI script that allows the user to configure frequency range, RBW, spectrum trace length, reference level, units, and capture interval and outputs a csv file that contains GPS info and a spectrum trace in each row.
Tested with Tektronix RSA306B and RSA507A with a Holux M-215+ USB GPS antenna.
